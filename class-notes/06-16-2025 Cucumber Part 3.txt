** INTERVIEW QUESTION: What is Scenario Outline and when do you use it? **

We use Scenario Outline when we need to run the same test for different sets of data. 
We use Scenario Outline instead of Scenario to declare a new test(s); we have to follow the Examples table to define the data sets. 

For each row (except the headers) --> the scenario will be executed


* Allure reports --> Playwright + Cypress  
* Extend reports --> Playwright + Cypress

- Data Tables ==> versatile structure used to provide detailed test data for a specific step within a scenario 
    - unlike Scenario Outlines --> Data Tables doesn't require any special keywords and is directly linked to the step
